      <h3>Chapter I – The Rising of the Dong</h3>
      <p>1. The void yawned wide, untouched, unknowable.
        And then—a stirring. The Glorious Dong, long dormant beneath the veils of fear and filtered desire,
        began to rise.</p>
      <p>2. It rose not as flesh alone,
        but as myth made firm.
        A shaft of clarity, absurd and undeniable,
        pointing toward everything that had ever been hidden.</p>
      <p>3. The people trembled.
        Some laughed. Some wept.
        Some scrolled past, too afraid to witness.</p>
      <p>4. But the Pilgrims knew.
        Deep in their loins and hearts they knew—
        something sacred had awakened.</p>
      <p>5. The Dong did not rise to conquer, it rose to reveal.
        To split the veil. To enter not the body, but the soul.</p>
